# DeepLearning-From_Scratch
Building brains out of math and vibes. Exploring Keras, PyTorch, TensorFlow, and Transformers through hands on experiments and controlled chaos. Bring snacks.

## What's Inside

This repo is my personal deep learning lab, a chaotic-but-curated mix of:
- Neural network architectures (from scratch and with frameworks)
- PyTorch and TensorFlow experiments
- Keras trials (for when I want comfort code)
- Transformer models and prompt engineering
- System prompts and agentic AI behaviour tests
- Notes, insights, and code from the trenches

## Why This Exists

Because tutorials are cool, but experience slaps harder.  
This repo is how I:
- Understand what actually happens under the hood
- Make mistakes and learn faster
- Build mini AI agents, tweak Transformers, and run cursed experiments

---

## Tech Stack

- Python 3.x
- PyTorch, TensorFlow, Keras
- HuggingFace Transformers(not sure)
- Jupyter + Google Colab
- Occasional caffeine

---

## Goals

- Master the foundations of deep learning
- Play with modern architectures (ViTs, LSTMs, CNNs, GPTs)
- Explore system prompts and agentic AI design
- Document my journey for future me (and maybe you too)

## Warning

This is not a polished tutorial repo. It’s a war journal.  
Expect:
- Half-working notebooks  
- Glorious breakthroughs  
- Occasional existential despair

You’ve been warned. Now grab your torch and dive in.
